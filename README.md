# Communicating with the Server

## Learning Goals

- Recall our Three Pillars of Web Programming
- Describe the process of communicating with the server
- Define AJAX

## Introduction

- what we've covered so far, sets up for the next steps

## Recall Our Three Pillars of Web Programming

- Manipulating the DOM
- Creating events
- Communicating with the server

## Describe the Process of Communicating With the Server

- In our example, “Favoriting” is a click event on a heart that updates the user’s DOM
- It also needs to notify the server so that the original poster can know you favorited it.
- This requires JavaScript to send a message to the server when the ‘click’ event runs. In this section we’ll explore how to add this effect to our “Favoriting” event


## Define AJAX

- Communicating with a server “behind the scenes” is known as the “AJAX technique” or AJAX
- We’ll start by getting data from the server
- But will then learn to send data to the server

## Conclusion

- prepares for the rest of the section
